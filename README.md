odl-scripts
===========

Scripts using OpenDaylight OpenFlow controller

The original-python directory contains files from the original repository and before the Hydrogen release of
OpenDaylight and therefore are not guaranteed to work anymore.

The odl-flow-configs directory contains important configurations for my application.

The files outside of the directory are currently not organized but should work.
